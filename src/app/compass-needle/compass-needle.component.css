      When screen orientation changes, magnetometer sensor values are supposed
      to automatically transform to stay in sync with screen coordinates when
      we specify {referenceFrame: 'screen'}.

      https://developer.chrome.com/articles/generic-sensor/#synchronization-with-screen-coordinates

      However, as of Chrome 112 the transform is backwards. When we are in landscape
      rotate-right, the transform is for rotate-left. And when we are in rotate-left,
      we receive rotate-right coordinates.

      Workaround: when in landscape mode, rotate 180 degrees.
