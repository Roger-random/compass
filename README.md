# Compass

The object of this project is to turn the rough
[magnetometer](https://github.com/Roger-random/nodejs_tests/tree/main/magnetometer)
prototype code into a nice-looking web app digitally emulating a compass.

## Angular

This project uses the
[Angular](https://angular.io)
application framework because I wanted a small practice exercise.
It doesn't actually need the full power (and overhead!) of Angular.
